About Project :

In 2020, Apple achieved carbon neutrality across its corporate operations. Apple 
accomplished this milestone through investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency 
measures, and carbon offset projects. In 2020, Apple initiated its 2030 carbon neutrality plan, 
announcing its ambitious goal to become carbon neutral across its entire value chain by 2030. 
Apple's plan focuses on reducing emissions by 75%, targeting a reduction to 9.6 million 
metric tons of CO2, and removing the remaining 25% through carbon removal projects. 


Task Assigned: 
For the Maven Environmental Challenge, I will be working as an independent journalist and 
data visualization enthusiast. My task is to use the data provided by Apple in their 
Environmental Progress Reports to visualize their progress toward achieving carbon 
neutrality by 2030. 


Data: 
Three datasets are provided to analyse Apple's progress toward carbon neutrality by 2030. 
The "Greenhouse Gas Emissions" table contains the sources of Apple's greenhouse gas 
emissions from 2015 to 2022, divided by category (corporate and product life cycle), scope 
(direct scope 1 emissions and indirect scope 2 and 3 emissions), and type (emissions and 
removals). The "Carbon Footprint by Product" table contains emissions from the product life 
cycle of every baseline iPhone model released between 2015-2022. The "Normalizing 
Factors" table contains Apple's revenue, market cap, and employees during the same period. 


Insights: 

• By 2022, Apple reduced its carbon emissions by 47.17% (~20.3 million metric tons of 
CO2e). 
• Apple saw a 68.7% increase in revenue as of 2022, indicating that its sustainability 
program did not impact sales and boosted revenue. 
• After 2019, corporate carbon emissions started to decline, and by 2020, Apple 
achieved carbon neutrality in its corporate operations. 
• Product life cycle emissions also decreased gradually from 38 million metric tons in 
2015 to 20.2 million in 2022. 
• The segments that contributed the most to carbon emissions during the product life 
cycle are manufacturing (66.3% of total product life cycle carbon emissions), 
followed by product use (24.3%) and product transportation (9.4%). However, 
Apple's innovation has helped control emissions over the years. 
• Apple's path toward net-zero carbon emissions not only benefited the environment but 
also boosted the company's revenue and market capitalization. In 2020, when Apple 
announced its 2030 carbon neutrality program, both revenue and market share grew. 
• Through innovation, Apple has reduced the carbon footprint of its recent products 
over the years. The iPhone X had the highest carbon footprint (79 kg CO2e), but 
newer products have reduced this number. The recent iPhone 15 is recorded to have 
produced 56 kg CO2e, approximately equal to its older models like the iPhone 7 and 
6s, indicating that innovation and sustainability can go hand in hand. 
• Over the years, Apple also invested in carbon offset programs starting in 2020, which 
were able to reduce carbon emissions by 1.06 million metric tons of CO2e.
